# Cez02's Password Vault

Hi, this is an app I created out of pure boredom for storing passwords. Created in WPF (.NET) it stores your passwords with their corresponding tags in an encrypted file, the key being a custom one you enter when you register.

## Why?

Prior to this app I stored all my passwords in a very secret location in a text file. Not even encrypted. Given I was too lazy to also look for an actually good program for storing your passwords, I decided to do a little exercise and make my own one. It's not the most beautiful one, but it gets the job done.

## Any plans on expanding?

None at the moment. Maybe a day will come when I work on the front-end. I am also not totally into cybersecurity, so there's a chance my app the least safe password vault out there (although I doubt it).

## Builds

[Here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1RxUshh4dcRtH33xCuFmwe1MPPsgrH60D/view?usp=sharing) should be the latest build (unless I forgot to upload the latest one).
