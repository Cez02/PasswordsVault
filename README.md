# Cez02's Password Vault

Hi, this is an app I created out of pure boredom for storing passwords. Created in WPF (.NET) it stores your passwords with their corresponding tags in an encrypted file, the key being a custom one you enter when you register.

## Why?

Prior to this app I stored all my passwords in a very secret location in a text file. Not even encrypted. Given I was too lazy to also look for an actually good program for storing your passwords, I decided to do a little exercise and make my own one. It's not the most beautiful one, but it gets the job done.

## Any plans on expanding?

None at the moment. Maybe a day will come when I work on the front-end. I am also not totally into cybersecurity, so there's a chance my app is the least safe password vault out there (although I doubt it).

## Usage

To use the program simply build or download a release, plop it into some folder anywhere on your PC and launch it. I like to hook it up to my start menu or toolbar (or both), whatever you desire.
